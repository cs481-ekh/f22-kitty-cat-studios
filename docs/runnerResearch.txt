runner research

RunnerWheel.cpp:
handles wheel width and radius
skid threshold
steering angle
friction force
soring rate and suspension

runner.cpp
handles movement and speed

runner1
big tires
springy suspension 
large friction force
little to no slip
slower but big jumps?

runner 2
fast
small tires
no spring in suspension
lots of slip
fast but can jump too high

sprint 1 make the game handle multiple runner options
sprint 1 runner 1
