# Existing Game Behavior
This document's purpose is to document the current game behavior (09/09/2022) in order to analyze and understand the steps that need to be taken next to add polish to the game.

## Car Behavior
The car can drive forward and backwards using the 'W' and 'S' keys, it looks like there's no way to turn the car unless you are moving forward or backwards. Ocassionally there is a sound effect when the car is speeding up in either direction. When jumping there is a when going up but no sound effect when landing. When the car is in the air the rotation/tilt of it can be controlled. If you die while moving, the moving sound effect continues to play until you respawn. When hitting an enemy or getting hit, there is no indication that you have been hit or that the enemy has been hit. The health bar at the bottom is the only indicator. When shooting, the gun will lock on to the nearest enemy and when firing it will shoot that car. There doesn't seem to be very much feedback when it comes to shooting. There is a sound effect but that's about it. If no enemies are near, the car will shoot straight forward. There were certain points that I got stuck due to the cars controls.
