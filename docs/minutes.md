~45 minutes

Broke down the AI project road map. Decided what will be done in each sprint for AI. 

## Whole Team Meeting 2/4 

Present: Everyone
Absent: No one
Scribe: Ross/Marie

~2 hours

We spent about 45 minutes troubleshooting environment issues and ensuring that everyone was set up for sprint 0.

The rest of the meeting was spent going through the project plan section by section to ensure that it would be ready by the due date. 

## Morning meeting 2/1 (Week 4)

Present: Joey, Saulo, Ben, Doug, Ross
Absent: DJ, Marie
Scribe: Ross

~15 minutes

Discussed what was left to do for the project setup:
  - Make sure everyone signs and submits the Team Contract
  - Make sure everyone is a contributor on the repository
We are going to reuse the previously made license
Saulo may take responsibility for designing the second level if the powerups don't take too long

## Sponsor meeting 1/29 (Week 3)

Present: All
Scribe: Ross

Discussed the project's requirements:
  - Developer requirements (noted as not important to the sponsor)
  - Working source code (Upon realizing there were still issues with the provided source code, the sponsor agreed to make     an effort to provide a functional version of the old source code [now accomplished])
Asked questions about sponsor's expectations:
  - The previous team started setting up Jenkins and Docker, should we work on integrating them into our project?
    - The sponsor explained that it would be very difficult to use CI/CD with this project, so it is not a requirement
  - Do we need to make a Mac-compatible release of the game?
    - The sponsor will not require that
  - What should we do if we can't get the old code to work?
    - The sponsor responded by asking if we wanted to start from scratch
      - We do not want to start from scratch, but if there is an issue with an aspect of the old code that we 
      can't figure out, we may choose to re-write that aspect from scratch
  - What does the sponsor want to see in the game?
    - Required: Scoring, game modes, smarter AI, power-ups, distinct AI (different attributes for different AI affecting
    their performance in the game as well as unique models), explosion effect on destruction [may be a stretch goal]
    - Stretch goals: Another level, dynamic soundtrack, local high-score system
  - Milestones:
    * Milestone 1 is to get the game testable for everyone on the team
    * Milestone 2 is to split up into groups adding required features of the game (sponsor expects this to be finished
    before the midpoint of the semester)
    * Milestone 3 is to merge all the new features of the game into a playable version of the game
    * Milestone 4 is to add stretch goals while continuing to have a playable version of the game
  - Contingencies:
    - If milestone one takes too long, we will have to cut planned features to adjust for that.
    - If portions of the existing code can't be fixed they will have to be replaced with new code from scratch, which
    could take enough time to have to cut planned features of the game
  - Communicataion:
    - No regularly scheduled sponsor meetings since our sponsor happens to see us in class, but we are encouraged to
    ask to schedule sponsor meetings as needed
    - Rather than waiting for a collection of issues that require our sponsor's attention to send our sponsor an email,
    we are encouraged to send emails regarding problems we are facing as they arrive (or discuss during class)
  - Deliverables:
    - Just an executable version of the (playable) game [sponsor only, our teacher also wants our source code] by 
    April 27

Planning for sponsor meeting
M1: get it running
M2: add xyz feature
M3: having tasks completed
M4: have the full project completed (refinement)
People in similar work areas should keep an eye on each other.
May have to drop some features to work on other, more important details.
