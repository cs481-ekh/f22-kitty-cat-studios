# AI Functions

## /Source/BroncoDrome/StageActors/AIActor.cpp

* AIActor.cpp is built off of /Source/BroncoDrome/Runner/Runner.cpp

### AI Shooting

* ShotDecision(FVector location) **Line 281**
    * For now, I believe we should keep this function for testing our tags and to shoot. If we use an if statement to have raycast look for our AIRunner tag, then shoot, that might give us better functionality.

* Fire() **Line 291**
    * This seems to be functional, itâ€™s doing some checks and then spawning the object to try and hit the player or AI runner.

### AI Target Locking

* QueryLockOnEngage() **Line 224**

* QueryLockOnDisengage() **Line 237**

* LockOn() **Line 249**
    * This function will check if it's currently locked on to a Runner. If not, it'll attempt to locate the closest Runner and lock on. If it is locked on, it'll stop targetting whichever Runner it was targeting and stop the lock on timer.

* drawTargetLine(FVector location) **Line 265**

###  AI Movement

* Raycast(FVector to) **Line 74**

* GetDirection() **Line 92**

* MoveDecision(FVector location) **Line 164**
