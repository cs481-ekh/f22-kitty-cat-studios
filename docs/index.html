    <h3 class="w3-wide">Abstract:</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">&emsp;BroncoDrome is a third-person shooter game based off of the 1996 game, DeathDrome. BroncoDrome is set at Boise State, whether it's Albertsons Stadium or the field by the Student Union Building. 
      The game was originally developed in Spring of 2021 and was continued by another team in the Spring of 2022. In the Fall of 2022, a new 8-person team took the development of BroncoDrome further. 
      Our goal was to enhance the original game while also creating new content. This took form in adding a new map, adding new game modes, reworking the UI as well as power-ups, adding new Runners and enhancing the AI.<br>
      &emsp;Eventually, we hope this game will assist freshman students so that they might get them familiar with the Boise State campus. We hope that the landmarks shown in the game will help the freshman be more familiar with the buildings and areas at 
      Boise State so that they will be able to navigate the campus easier.<br>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">What Was Built:</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">Using the Unreal 4.26-chaos game engine, we built from the previous teams progress. We used both C++ and Unreal's blueprints. For our 3D models, we used various external 3D modeling software that we then exported to our Unreal 
      project to be made into a UAsset. Using 4.26-chaos gave the previous teams access to go-kart functionality that would serve as the motor for the player Runner and AI Runners. We also used various Unreal libraries for UI, movement, AI and 
      testing.</p>
    <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">How It Works:</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">&emsp;When you start up a game of BroncoDrome, you start on a menu that will let you jump right in, view a tutorial to learn the 
        controls or check the high scores. Once you decide you're ready to play, you're presented with 3 gameplay options. Standard, 
        Survival or Freeplay. When playing the Standard gamemode, you'll spawn into a set playlist of maps with the goal of destroying 
        the enemy Runners before your lives run out. Each time you pass a stage, your lives will reset. If you get through the four maps,
        you'll have won the game. If you choose survival, you'll try to survive as long as possible while waves of enemy Runners spawn.
        Freeplay lets you choose what map you'd like to play to test various strategies more efficiently. Select your favorite Runner model
        of the three options before you start the run! <br><br>
        
        &emsp;There are also 3 gameplay difficulties. Rookie difficulty has reduced damage and enemy Runner accuracy while normal has the default difficulty settings. Once you're feeling confident, try out the Bronco difficulty
        that has increased damage taken and more accurate enemy Runners. Throughout each map, you and the enemy Runners will have access to 
        various power-ups. Use the power-ups to your advantage and get them quickly or your enemies may hold the advantage over you.
