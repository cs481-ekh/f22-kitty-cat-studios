    <h3 class="w3-wide">Abstract:</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">BroncoDrome is a third-person shooter game based off of the 1996 game, DeathDrome. BroncoDrome is set at Boise State, whether it's Albertsons Stadium or the field by the Student Union Building. 
      The game was originally developed in Spring of 2021 and was continued by another team in the Spring of 2022. In the Fall of 2022, a new 8-person team took the development of BroncoDrome further. 
      Our goal was to enhance the original game while also creating new content. This took form in adding a new map, adding new gamemodes, reworking the UI as well as power-ups, adding new Runners and enhancing the AI.<br>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">What Was Built:</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">Using the Unreal 4.26-chaos game engine, we built upon the foundation that was passed to us. We used a combination of C++ and Unreal Blueprints to achieve this.
      At the end of this development cycle we were able to provide a functioning, albeit simple, game where there are clear win and lose conditions as well as functioning power ups and AI opponents. We were able to revamp the maps that the previous team provided. 
      We were also able to add in a functioning high score system that persists on the local machine. One thing that was specifically asked of us from our sponsor was to make it so that a player can progress between levels, this was achieved where the player score also follows them
      as they progress.</p>

    <!-- How it Works Section -->
  <div class="w3-black" id="HIW">
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">How It Works:</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">This game pits the player against enemy, AI, "runners". The goal of the game is to defeat a certain number of enemies in the time alloted. A score is kept for each hit that the player gets on the enemies, this score is compounded with the remaining time
          and remaining player lives. This score can then be added to a High Score screen when applicable, these scores persist on the local machine where the game is installed. The maps have specific locations where power-ups spawn. Power-ups include a singular shot that destroys 
          an enemy on hit (Kill-ball), a damage-up power which increases the amount of damage the normal shots can do, a bullet-sponge that allows the player to soak up 3 shots, a health pack to allow the player to heal, and a speed-up which slightly boosts the speed of the player.
          There is also a tutorial screen in-game which tells the player how to play.
