    <h2 class="w3-wide">BRONCODROME</h2>
    <h3 class="w3-wide">Abstract:</h3>
    <p class="w3-justify">In 1996, Viacom released DeathDrome for Windows 95. DeathDrome was a third-person shooter game consisting of vehicular combat. Vehicles with unique attributes and various weapons would compete against each other, using power-ups scattered across the map to gain advantage over their opponents. Our sponsor, Eric Henderson, being a big fan of the game, wanted it to be remade to rekindle great memories.
      In the Fall 2021 semester, Boise State students created BroncoDrome in an attempt to realize our sponsor’s vision. The game was made using the Unreal Engine for a modern feel. However, a single semester did not prove to be enough time to remake the classic game from scratch. At the end of the semester the game was very barebones. The Fall 2021 semester team took the initial steps, but there were many more to take as we moved forward in the Spring 2022 semester.
      With this in mind, Team Gregg took up the baton in an attempt to make BroncoDrome become our sponsor's dream game. Our goal was to supply a semi-finished game with a functioning game loop. We set out to to implement most (if not all) of the missing features. In addition to adding these new features, we also intended to improve the pre-existing features, such as the menus, the music, and the AI opponent. We committed ourselves to realizing our sponsor’s dream.<br>

    <h2 class="w3-wide">What Was Built:</h2>
    <p class="w3-justify">Using the Unreal 4 (Chaos) game engine, we built upon the foundation that was passed to us. We used a combination of C++ and Unreal Blueprints to achieve this.
      At the end of this development cycle we were able to provide a functioning, albeit simple, game where there are clear win and lose conditions as well as functioning power ups and AI opponents. We were able to revamp the maps that the previous team provided. 
      We were also able to add in a functioning high score system that persists on the local machine. One thing that was specifically asked of us from our sponsor was to make it so that a player can progress between levels, this was achieved where the player score also follows them
      as they progress.</p>

    <!-- How it Works Section -->
  <div class="w3-black" id="HIW">
    <div class="w3-container w3-content w3-padding-64" style="max-width:800px">
      <h2 class="w3-wide w3-center">How It Works:</h2>
      <p class="w3-justify">This game pits the player against enemy, AI, "runners". The goal of the game is to defeat a certain number of enemies in the time alloted. A score is kept for each hit that the player gets on the enemies, this score is compounded with the remaining time
          and remaining player lives. This score can then be added to a High Score screen when applicable, these scores persist on the local machine where the game is installed. The maps have specific locations where power-ups spawn. Power-ups include a singular shot that destroys 
          an enemy on hit (Kill-ball), a damage-up power which increases the amount of damage the normal shots can do, a bullet-sponge that allows the player to soak up 3 shots, a health pack to allow the player to heal, and a speed-up which slightly boosts the speed of the player.
          There is also a tutorial screen in-game which tells the player how to play.
